Messing about with iPhone development from the command line.

This is a repo where I'll futz around trying to build up a Makefile and
directory structure that is suitable as a minimal iPhone application structure
that is penetrable with nothing more than an editor.  No IB.  No XCode.  I
suspect that seeing things from this perspective will help me understand what
wonderful things IB and XCode are making easy for me and take better advantage
of them.
